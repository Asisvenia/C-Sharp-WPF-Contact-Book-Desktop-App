# About
* This repository contains a simple app which is based on **WPF** and **C#** that implements **MVVM architecture**.
* Main purpose of this desktop app is to manage your contact book list, add or remove person and update contact information.
* To save data I used **Newtonsoft.Json** to serialize and unserialize saved data on the local disk.
